    This is a program written to allow easy editing of CLI pictures, saved in the .aspic format
    (AScii PICture). This format saves images as a 2D array of pixels. Each pixel contains three 
    values: the foreground colour (1 to 16), the background colour (1 to 16) and an integer value 
    between 1 and 8 inclusive indicating the blending format, as seen below:

    1   -   ░   -   Very light foreground colour, predominantly background colour
    2   -   ▒   -   50/50 mixture of foreground and background colours
    3   -   ▓   -   Very light background colour, predominantly foreground colour
    4   -   █   -   Solid block of foreground colour
    5   -   ▄   -   Bottom half foreground, top half background
    6   -   ▀   -   Bottom half background, top half foreground
    7   -   ▌   -   Left half foreground, right half background
    8   -   ▐   -   Left half background, right half foreground

    Each file also contains a header containing the width and height. Pixels, and the header, are
    separated by semicolons while individual values within each pixel and the header are separated
    by colons.
